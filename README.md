**ACDLCinst** is a DLC item inserter for *Animal Crossing City Folk* (also known as *Let's Go to the City* in PAL regions). To use this tool, you simply need to extract the game's savedata file *rvforest.dat* and drag it onto the executable.

# Features
Most DLC items have become unobtainable since the shutdown of Nintendo's online services for the DS and Wii consoles. However, using this tool, all DLC can be added to your game, including three previously unreleased items!
Furthermore, the catalogue data is patched and all items are immediately available to the player.

# Usage
In order to use the tool you need to extract your savefile from the Wii system. There are plenty of Homebrew apps for save data management, although I personally recommend *SaveGame Manager GX* (https://wiibrew.org/wiki/SaveGame_Manager_GX). After dumping your savefile, simply drag it onto *ACDLCinst.exe* and you're done! Reinsert the save file with your preferred manager and boot the game. It's that simple!
